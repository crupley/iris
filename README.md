This readme under construction...

My attempt at coding a clustering algorithm as applied to the iris dataset.

## Data: 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data

## Algorithm
* initialize centroids
* assign datapoint to nearest centroid
* update centroid location to center of mass
* iterate until convergence
